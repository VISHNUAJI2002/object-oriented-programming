# Object-Oriented Programming Repository

This repository contains structured, concept-based examples demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in **Python** and **Java**. The repository is divided into two major sections:

1. **mca-s2/** – Coursework exercises completed as part of the MCA Semester 2 curriculum.
2. **python/** and **java/** – Personal exploration and self-driven implementation of OOP concepts beyond the formal syllabus.

This separation clearly distinguishes academic work from independent learning and experimentation.

Each folder contains one or more programs demonstrating the respective OOP concept using clean, focused examples.

## Standard File Structure

Every program in this repository follows a consistent three-part structure:

### 1. Problem Statement (Top of the File)

A concise explanation of the task and the OOP concept being demonstrated.

### 2. Code Implementation

A complete working solution written using appropriate OOP principles such as:

- Class definitions
- Constructors
- Methods
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

Where relevant, programs are input-driven to demonstrate real usage.

### 3. Sample Output (Bottom of the File)

A clear example of the expected program output.

**Template:**

```python
"""
Problem:
Describe the objective here.
"""

# Code implementation

"""
Sample Output:
Show the expected output here.
"""
```

This structure ensures uniformity and clarity across all files.

## Concepts Covered

### Python

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- Simulated Method Overloading
- Encapsulation using private attributes and getters/setters
- Abstraction using the `abc` module

### Java

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- MCA S2 CO2 practical programs

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended for:

- MCA students following the KTU syllabus
- Beginners learning Python or Java OOP
- Interview preparation
- Maintaining a clean portfolio of OOP concepts
- Anyone seeking structured examples of core OOP principles

The goal is clarity rather than complexity. Each file is self-contained and concept-focused.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

If you add new programs in the future:

1. Place the file in the appropriate concept folder.
2. Follow the three-part structure (Problem → Code → Sample Output).
3. Use a clear commit message:

```
Add <filename>
```
